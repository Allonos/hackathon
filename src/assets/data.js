    question: 'What is space weather and what are its most recognizable effects?',
    option1: 'Space weather refers to changing conditions in near-Earth space caused by particles and matter from the Sun, with auroras being the most visible effect.',
    option2: 'Space weather describes changes in the Earth’s lower atmosphere due to weather patterns.',
    option3: 'Space weather is a phenomenon that only occurs during the night.',
    option4: "Space weather only affects areas within 50 miles of the Earth's poles.",
    ans: 1,
  },
  {
    question: 'Why was space weather added to the Government National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies in 2011?',
    option1: 'It was added to protect wildlife from increased solar radiation.',
    option2: 'The government added it because space weather impacts rainfall and drought cycles.',
    option3: 'It was included to monitor seasonal temperature fluctuations.',
    option4: 'Space weather was added because it poses a threat to national infrastructure and technology.',
    ans: 4,
  },
  {
    question: 'How do geomagnetic storms create auroras, and where are they typically seen?',
    option1: "Auroras are formed when charged particles from the solar wind interact with Earth’s atmosphere, usually near the poles.",
    option2: 'Auroras are formed by thunderstorms in the lower atmosphere and are visible everywhere on Earth.',
    option3: "Auroras are created when the Earth's magnetic field changes color, and they are seen near the equator.",
    option4: 'Auroras form when solar radiation reacts with water vapor in the clouds.',
    ans: 1,
  },
  {
    question: 'What are some key impacts of space weather on satellite systems and power grids?',
    option1: 'Space weather only affects the performance of home appliances.',
    option2: 'Space weather can disrupt satellite electronics and induce electric currents in power lines, causing grid failures.',
    option3: 'Satellites become more efficient during space weather events because of extra energy from the Sun.',
    option4: 'Space weather has no significant impact on power grids, only on small electronic devices.',
    ans: 2,
  },
  {
    question: 'How can space weather affect communication systems, particularly in aviation and maritime navigation?',
    option1: 'It only affects land-based communication systems and has no effect on aviation or maritime signals.',
    option2: 'Space weather improves communication systems by increasing signal strength.',
    option3: 'Space weather can disrupt high-frequency radio communications used in aviation and navigation.',
    option4: 'Space weather can lead to clearer communication in all weather conditions.',
    ans: 3,
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the causes of geomagnetic storms, and how do coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun contribute to them?',
    option1: "They are a result of volcanic eruptions affecting the Earth's magnetic field.",
    option2: 'Geomagnetic storms are caused by lightning strikes on the Earth’s surface.',
    option3: "Geomagnetic storms are caused by CMEs from the Sun disturbing Earth’s magnetic field, creating electric currents.",
    option4: 'Geomagnetic storms are triggered by strong winds in Earth’s atmosphere interacting with the magnetic field.',
    ans: 3,
  },
  {
    question: 'What are some of the risks posed by geomagnetic storms to human health, especially for airline crews and astronauts?',
    option1: 'Geomagnetic storms increase radiation levels, which can pose risks to airline crews and passengers on polar routes, as well as astronauts in space.',
    option2: 'Geomagnetic storms cause an immediate increase in sea levels, affecting coastal populations.',
    option3: 'Geomagnetic storms cause hallucinations for people flying at high altitudes.',
    option4: 'Geomagnetic storms can increase radiation levels, which pose risks to airline crews and astronauts.',
    ans: 4,
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Kp index, and how is it used to categorize the severity of geomagnetic storms on the G-Scale?',
    option1: 'The Kp index measures the speed of solar wind and is used to predict thunderstorms.',
    option2: 'The Kp index measures geomagnetic disturbances and is used to categorize storm severity from G-1 to G-5.',
    option3: 'The Kp index is a measure of how hot the upper atmosphere becomes during space weather events.',
    option4: 'The Kp index tracks the number of visible auroras during the night.',
    ans: 2,
